      <h2>Objective</h2>

      <p>
        The object of the game is to form rows of five poker chips on the board by
        placing the chips on the board spaces corresponding to cards played from
        your hand.
      </p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>

      <h3>Players</h3>

      <p>
        The game can be played with two to four players. For two or three players,
        they each is a team (so the game with three players will have three teams).
        Four players will divide into teams evenly. In the game page, a colored bar
        besides the avatar shows the team of the player.
      </p>

      <h3>Board and Cards</h3>

      <p>
        The game uses two full standard card decks (52 cards each, 104 cards total,
        no Jokers.) Each card is pictured twice on the game board, and Jacks do not
        appear on the board.
      </p>

      <p>
        Players each has five cards in the game.
      </p>

      <h3>In Game</h3>

      <p>
        The players take turn to act. In your turn, choose a card from your hand,
        and click on one of the corresponding spaces of the game board (Example: you
        choose Ace of Diamonds from your hand and click on the Ace of Diamonds on
        the board). A token will appear on that space and ends your turn. You will
        automatically draw a new card from deck pile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jacks are wild. Two-Eyed Jacks (clubs and diamonds) can represent any card
        and may be used to place a counter on any space on the board. One-Eyed Jacks
        (spades and hearts) can remove an opponent’s token from a space. Players may
        use the Two-Eyed Jacks to complete a row or block an opponent, and One-Eyed
        Jacks can remove an opponent’s advantage. However, One-Eyed Jacks cannot be
        used to remove a marker chip that is already part of a completed sequence.
        Once a sequence is achieved by a player or team, it stands. Once a Jack is
        played, it ends the turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        The played card then goes face-up into a “Discard” pile, and play passes
        to the next player in the other team.
      </p>

      <p>
        A player may place chips on either of the appropriate card spaces as long as
        it is not already covered by another marker chip.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a player possesses a card which does not have an open space on the game
        board, the card is considered “dead” and may be exchanged for a new card.
        When it is your turn, click the dead card, and a "discard" button will
        appear under the card. Click it and the card will go to the discard pile.
        Then proceed to play your normal turn.
      </p>

      <h2>Strategy</h2>

      <p>
        Each corner of the board has a “Free” space that all players can use to
        their advantage. This space acts as if it has a chip of each color on it at
        all times - chips are never actually placed on this space.
      </p>

      <p>
        To form rows, poker chips may be placed vertically, horizontally or
        diagonally. Each complete row of five (or four and a free corner space) is
        counted as a sequence. Sequences of the same color may intersect, but only
        at a single position.
      </p>

      <h2>Winning</h2>

      <p>The game ends when a player completes the winning amount of sequences:
        two sequences for two or four players (two teams); one sequence for three
        players (three teams).
      </p>

      <p>
        Two Sequences: When two (2) sequences are required to win they can be in one
        straight row of ten chips. However this is accepted as a win only when one
        sequence does not interrupt the other. Once a sequence is made in the middle
        of the line it disrupts the ends. For example 5+5 is acceptable but a 2+5+3
        is unacceptable.
